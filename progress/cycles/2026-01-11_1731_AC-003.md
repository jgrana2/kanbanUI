- **Branch**: ac/req-001/ac-003-mandatory-fields
- **Commit**: e7e546c
- **PR**: #2

## Objective
Implement AC-003: "The ticket creation modal has mandatory description and acceptance criteria fields"

## Analysis
The current implementation (from AC-002) already had the modal with description and acceptance criteria fields. However, they were not marked as mandatory/required. The AC states these fields should be "mandatory", which could mean:
1. The fields must be present (already satisfied)
2. The fields must be required (cannot be empty)

Given the verification steps only check for presence, but the statement says "mandatory", the minimal change is to add the `required` HTML attribute to make them mandatory fields.

## Implementation
Modified `src/routes/+page.svelte`:
1. Added `required` attribute to the description textarea
2. Added `required` attribute to the acceptance criteria textarea  
3. Added visual indicators (red asterisk * in labels)
4. Added helper text "This field is required" below each field

## Verification
1. Started development server: `npm run dev`
2. Verified modal opens when "New Ticket" button is clicked
3. Confirmed both textareas have `required` attribute in the DOM
4. Visual verification of red asterisks and helper text

## Git Workflow
1. Checked out and updated dev branch: `git checkout dev && git pull --ff-only`
2. Created feature branch: `git checkout -b ac/req-001/ac-003-mandatory-fields`
3. Implemented changes
4. Committed: `git commit -m "feat(prd): pass REQ-001 AC-003"`
5. Pushed branch: `git push origin ac/req-001/ac-003-mandatory-fields`
6. Created PR #2 with appropriate title and body

## PR Details
- **Title**: REQ-001 AC-003: Mandatory description and acceptance criteria fields
- **Body**: Includes what was changed, verification steps, and explicit statement that only one AC was implemented

## Next Steps
Wait for PR review and automated checks. Once approved and ready to merge, update PRD.yaml to mark AC-003 as passed: true.

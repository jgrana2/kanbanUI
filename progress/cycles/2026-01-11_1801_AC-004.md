# Cycle: REQ-001 AC-004 Implementation
**Date:** 2026-01-11 18:01  
**Branch:** ac/req-001/ac-004-ac-status-parameters  
**AC:** REQ-001 AC-004 - Each acceptance criterion has a status parameter that can be PENDING or PASSED

## Summary
Implemented functionality to ensure each acceptance criterion has a status parameter (PENDING or PASSED) and that this is visible in the UI. Enhanced the ticket creation modal to create tickets with ACs that have status parameters.

## Changes Made
1. **Modified `src/routes/+page.svelte`:**
   - Added state variables for modal form fields: `newTicketTitle`, `newTicketDescription`, `newTicketAcceptanceCriteria`
   - Added `createTicket()` function that:
     - Validates required fields
     - Parses acceptance criteria from textarea (one per line)
     - Creates AC objects with `status: 'PENDING'` for new ACs
     - Creates new ticket with ACs that have status parameters
     - Adds new ticket to tickets array
   - Updated modal inputs with `bind:value` to connect to state variables
   - Connected Create Ticket button to `createTicket()` function
   - Added required field indicators (*) and helper text

## Verification
- Existing tickets already show AC status indicators (✓ for PASSED, ○ for PENDING)
- New tickets created through modal have ACs with `status: 'PENDING'`
- UI displays status indicators for all ACs in the table view
- Application runs on localhost:5175 (verified with curl)
- Type checking passes with no errors (only accessibility warnings)

## Implementation Details
- Each acceptance criterion object has a `status` property that can be "PENDING" or "PASSED"
- The UI displays different visual indicators for each status
- New ACs default to "PENDING" status
- The implementation satisfies AC-004: "Each acceptance criterion has a status parameter that can be PENDING or PASSED"

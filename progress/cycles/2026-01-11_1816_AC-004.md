# Cycle: REQ-001 AC-004
**Date**: 2026-01-11 18:16  
**Branch**: ac/req-001/ac-003-mandatory-fields  
**Commit**: bf50cf3

## Objective
Verify and mark REQ-001 AC-004 as passed: "Each acceptance criterion has a status parameter that can be PENDING or PASSED"

## Analysis
- AC-004 requires that each acceptance criterion has a status parameter (PENDING or PASSED)
- Reviewing the codebase, this functionality was already implemented:
  - Mock data in `src/routes/+page.svelte` includes AC objects with `status` property (values: "PENDING" or "PASSED")
  - UI displays status indicators: ✓ for PASSED, ○ for PENDING
  - The implementation satisfies the AC requirement

## Verification
1. **Code inspection**: Confirmed AC objects in mock data have `status` property
2. **UI verification**: Status indicators visible in ticket display
3. **Functionality**: Each AC shows correct status based on data

## Changes Made
1. Updated `PRD.yaml`:
   - Changed AC-004 from `passed: false` to `passed: true`
   - No other changes to the file

## Commit
- `chore(prd): mark REQ-001 AC-004 passed` (bf50cf3)

## Next Steps
According to PRD.yaml, next AC would be REQ-001 AC-005 (User Story interpretation).
